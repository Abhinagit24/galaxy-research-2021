# Undergrad research-2021 - Galaxy evolution

We searched for ‘E+A galaxy candidates’ in the 10 sq degree region around the Coma Cluster by using the SDSS Skyserver. The E+A criteria described in the 2021 research paper by Greene et al was used for selecting the possible E + A candidates by looking at the Hβ, H𝛾, and H𝛿 equivalent width values, presence of H𝛼 and [OII] emissions, bluer slope for continuum and Dn4000 break values of the galaxies in the region. The spectra of thousands of galaxies were analyzed in google sheets using  the Falcone method. We selected 136 possible E+A candidates altogether from the region and these selected galaxies were rated 1 to 3 such that 1 being most likely E+A and 3 being somewhat E+A. Further we created the plot of E+A candidates in the region and discussed the possible reasons for the observed pattern of E+A candidates in the region by comparing the obtained plot with the X-ray map of the cluster. Later, further research was done by Y/Dim collaboration by using SDSS-IV MaNGA integral field survey on selected E + A candidates to calculate the dust corrected luminosities, star formation rates, and ionization gas to determine whether ram pressure stripping has affected these galaxies.
